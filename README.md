# DocuMine: Text Mining & Preprocessing Pipeline ðŸ“šâœ¨

This project performs fundamental **text preprocessing techniques** on a collection of text documents as part of a Data Mining assignment. It includes steps like tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming, preparing documents for further analysis.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
- Load multiple raw `.txt` documents from a directory
- Clean and tokenize text using NLTK
- Remove stopwords and apply stemming
- Prepare text for data mining tasks like frequency analysis or similarity computations

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- Python 3
- NLTK
- os, math, collections

## ðŸ§  Key Features
- Custom function to load and preprocess `.txt` documents
- Tokenization using regex (alphabetic-only)
- English stopword filtering
- Porter stemming applied to tokens
- Document tracking for multiple file support
